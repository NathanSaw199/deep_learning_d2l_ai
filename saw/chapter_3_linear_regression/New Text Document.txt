ventured out alone, barely sixteen 
spent my teenage years for the Australian dream 
struggling is norm, like I die in the scrim 
never had someone asked "How the fuck I've been?"
at what cost? I give it up my sanity 
I will never  feel remorse, I've done that for my family
I told my bro, you shouldn't stress about money and destiny
I'll pay your bills to let you live in danger peacefully

good kid mad city ? that sentence will never work for me
they rather see bloods to Glee
