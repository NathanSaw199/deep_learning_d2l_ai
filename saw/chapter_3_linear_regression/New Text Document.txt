ventured out alone, barely sixteen 
spent my teenage years for the american  dream 
struggling is norm, like I die  in scrim 
never had someone asked "How the fuck I've been?"
at what cost? I give it up my sanity 
I will never  feel remorse, I've done that for my family
this drudgery as my job, been working earnestly
made a promise to myself, get outta poverty
Good kid mad city, we from Yangon
hustlers  and bustlers we brother in bond 
got courage and resilience, never fuck around 
"In the quiet of your slumber, we craft the dawn."


how do you think you may ever have the fair chance?
you got all these fun  when, I'm sweating in the slience 
your time has come, take the hell outta  the burden
you can't do none, you gotta accept it's your turn
